This e-commerce web application for leasing services is designed with scalability, security, and rapid deployment in mind.

The architecture leverages fully managed AWS services to reduce operational overhead while ensuring high availability.

- -**Frontend** is hosted on Amazon S3 with CloudFront (optional) for low-latency global delivery.
- -**Backend** is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, enabling automated deployment and scaling.
- -**Database** is built with Amazon Aurora Serverless (PostgreSQL), providing cost-effective on-demand capacity.
- -**Authentication** is managed via Amazon Cognito, supporting secure user registration and federated identities.
- -**Security**: Data at rest is encrypted using AWS KMS, and access is managed with IAM roles and policies.
- This modular and cloud-native setup ensures the platform is ready for rapid iterations, A/B testing, and production scaling.

**Improvement Path:**

 Backend workloads can later be migrated to Amazon ECS (Fargate) for better control over containerized deployments.
 
 Based on usage metrics, the database layer can evolve from serverless to provisioned Aurora instances to optimize cost-performance.
